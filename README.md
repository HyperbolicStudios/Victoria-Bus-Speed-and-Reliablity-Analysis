A dashboard that summarizes bus speed measures in Victoria, BC. Relies on historical data captured by my bus speed tracker ([Github](https://github.com/HyperbolicStudios/YYJ-Bus-Speed-Tracker))

Currently includes:
* Maps showing system speeds on and off peak, and a visualization of where there's the greatest difference in peak vs off-peak speeds
* Average speeds for key corridors
* Bus speeds ranked by average speed
* Historical runtimes (based on historical GTFS static data captured by [transitland](https://www.transit.land/))
